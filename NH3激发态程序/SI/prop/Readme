This directory contains the diabatic property surface for plotting and testing purpose.
The adiabatic surface can be constructed from diabatic one through the inverse AtD transformation,
given the rotation angle can be easily obtained from the quasi-diabatic Hamiltonian matrix. 
It should be pointed out that the property surface is highly dependent on the completeness of the PES,
which will all be updated as requested by dynamics. Users can found the latest surface from
the group github page https://github.com/yarkonygrp/surfaces
