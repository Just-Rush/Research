This is the coupled quasi-diabatic Hamiltonian of the first two singlets of NH3.
The triplet state Hamiltonian is in t1 directory. The diabatic dipole and spin-orbit
coupling is in prop directory.

This NN surface has been tested on 64bit Linux platform with intel compiler and
MKL library (Makefile.intel). The user could also use gfortran, blas and
lapack library (Makefile.gnu) if the intel counterparts are not available.

nn.f90 pes.f90 are the source codes for NN PES.
main.f90 provides a sample calling: first call subroutine(pesinit or dmsinit)
to initialize the PES, then call the evaluation subroutine (NNEvaluate or Evalutexxx)

In the test directory, the user can simply enter ../test.x in command line
to run the testing program. The test directory contains all the definition
files needed to use this PES.
